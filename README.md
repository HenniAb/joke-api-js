# Joke with API-JS

A lightweight and a simple Joke app created in JavaScript with API.

This project was a lightweight JS-based Joke taker, done in order to pick up and further strengthen my skills in javascript. 
As a result whilst it isn't the prettiest or most functional it  was done in order to increase my proficiency in the languages.
